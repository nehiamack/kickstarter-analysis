# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns 
Performing analysis on kickstarter to uncover trends
Conditional formatting was applied to color code the successful vs failed outcomes and also the percentage funded.
The color is green for successful campaigns and red for failed campaigns. The percentage funded is on a gradient from red to blue with 100% and above being red and as the numbers decline it is indicated by a shade of blue.
I inserted a row to find the average donation in order to get a better understanding of the data.
I separated the category and subcategory column to futher analyze more specific data.
In the tab 'Category Statistics', I created a pivot table and bar chart showing the outcomes of the data set.

I created two additional columns showing the Date Created Conversion and the Date Ended Conversion.
I then created a line chart that shows trends over time. The more successful campaigns kicked off in May.

I then analyzed the data in the 'Failed US Kickstarters' and 'Successful US Kickstarters' in order to look for trends.
Those trends can be found in the 'Descriptive Statistics' sheet and visually in the 'Chart 1' sheet.
